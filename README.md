:factory: :bar_chart: Online monitoring and exploitation of data in a company using Ignition and SAP ERP.

## Abstract
The aim of this project is make an industrial solution for analysis and performance level evaluations of distributed manufacturing lines. 

This solutions will be used for Ebrofood in some of their fabrics that are being technologicaly updated. In order to achieve this the solutions must give priority to escalability.

Textend of the project led to has led to the need for a group effort among this company specialists
in different subjects and the authors of this project. So in the process converge: 
- On one hand, **industrial engineering** where all the data extraction is done.
- On the other hand **computer science** which is is responsible for the automation of these processes and the subsequent processing of these data.

These two areas, once independent of each other, are increasingly related thanks to the appearance
Industry 4.0.

This project has two differents parts

### [Part I: Online monitoring systems of distributed manufacturing chains.][link_partI]
The aim of this work is done from the convergence between information technologies and operational technologies. The project has some objectives that it is needed to achieve for the company with we have worked, EbroFoods. These objectives include the realization of a guide to help other engineers to introduce themselves in industrial world, the replication of the company's work environment and a comparison of the different tools that are being considered
for use it in the company.

First to all, a study will be done about the production process and the data extraction that are carried out in them. The study will analyze the different elements that we found during this process and the role they play. In addition, it will be seen how they are used and how all of them are interconnected.

Then, fulfilling one of the main objectives, we will proceed to the replication of the company's work environment. To achieve this, the tools EbroFoods uses nowadays will be studied. Also,a comparison will be made in order to analyze new tools for its use in the company. Finally,we will have a planning using the SCRUM methodology to organize the development of the project.

The development of the project is based on the creation of a system that allows collecting data from the processing plants and to control the machines that exits in each of the lines. In order to do this, one of the tools previously studied will be selected and tested in the work environment with the aim of checking its performance. Finally, conclusions will be made about the results of the project and the importance they have,to chain with the second part of the work.

### [Part II: Analysis and avaluation of distributed manufacturing chains performance levels.][link_partII]
The main subject is focused on ERPs and the exploitation of data in a company. It will explain how to treat the data since it arrives from the factory until it is finally use as the company's efficiency indicators. The main objectives that EbroFoods needed to meet is that we get used to use SAP -ERP that the company is working with- and
some of its modules. In addition, a comparison will be made between different reporting tools and we will use one of them to make a report with real factory data.

In the first place we will be studying the set of software tools that EbroFoods uses to perform a distributed work. Among these elements are SAP and its modules, a virtualization system and database. We will analyze where they are located in the company and how they relate to each other.

On the other hand, we will see how to evaluate the performance of manufacturing lines using the main standard measure for this, the OEE. This calculation will be used in a report system, which the company commissioned with this project. For this, we will proceed to the study of the internal software scheme of the company and the previously mentioned comparison. For the realization of all this we will do a planning based on SCRUM methodology.

To continue the guide created in the previous project, the entire process of creating the reporting system will be documented. We will start with the design of the reports and then -after the implementation- the consequent validation of the results.

Finally, a conclusion will be made about the results of the project and the work that could be
done in the future.
